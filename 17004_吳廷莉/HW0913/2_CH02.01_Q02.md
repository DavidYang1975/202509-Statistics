## Answer:
### Then calculate the sample standard deviation


### b. What proportion of the children were 35 months or older, but less than 45 months of age when first enrolled in preschool?
| Frequency| Frequency|
|--------------|------|
| 30-34        | 12   |
| 35-39        | 15   |
| 40-44        | 12   |
| 45-49        | 8    |
| 50-54        | 2    |
| 55+      | 1    |

$\text{Proportion} = \frac{(15+12)}{50} = \frac{27}{50} = 0.54 $
### c. If one child were selected at random from this group of children, what is the probability that the child was less than 50 months old when first enrolled in preschool?
$\text{Probability} = \frac{(50-2-1)}{50} = \frac{47}{50} = 0.94 $
