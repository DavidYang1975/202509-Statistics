### b. What proportion of the children were 35 months or older, but less than 45 months of age when first enrolled in preschool?
| Frequency| Frequency|
|--------------|------|
| 30-34        | 12    |
| **35-39**        | **15**   |
| **40-44**        | **12**    |
| 45-49        | 8    |
| 50-54        | 2    |
| 55+      | 1    |


$$\text{proportion} = \frac{(15+12)}{50} = \frac{27}{50}$$
