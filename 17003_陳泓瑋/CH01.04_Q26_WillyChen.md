**Part B: Proportion of Children 35 to Less than 45 Months Old**

Frequency for 35-39 months: 14 children

Frequency for 40-44 months: 12 children

The total number of children in this range is 14+12=26.

The proportion is the number of children in this range divided by the total number of children (50).
Proportion = 26/50=0.52.

The proportion of children who were 35 months or older but less than 45 months of age is 0.52, or 52%.
