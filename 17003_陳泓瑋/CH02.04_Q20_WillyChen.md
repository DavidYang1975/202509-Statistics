**a. Calculate the five-number summary for the data.**  
Five-Number Summary:

Minimum: 1.70

$Q_1$: 143.00

Median: 246.50

$Q_3$: 323.50

Maximum: 485.00

**b. Draw a box plot for the data.**

---
**c. Are there any outliers?**  
$IQR=Q_3−Q_1$=323.50−143.00=180.50

Lower Bound: $Q_1−1.5×IQR$=143.00−1.5×180.50=143.00−270.75=−127.75

Since no value can be negative, there are no lower outliers.

Upper Bound: $Q_3+1.5×IQR$=323.50+1.5×180.50=323.50+270.75=594.25

The maximum value (485.00) is less than the upper bound (594.25).
Based on the $1.5×IQR$ rule, there are no outliers in this data set.
