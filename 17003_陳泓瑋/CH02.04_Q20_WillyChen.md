**a. Calculate the five-number summary for the data.**  
Five-Number Summary:

Minimum: 1.70

$Q_1$: 130.50

Median: 246.50

$Q_3$: 317.50

Maximum: 485.00

**b. Draw a box plot for the data.**  
<img width="787" height="590" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6438299a-f25e-4fc5-a445-ae284b574d37" />

**c. Are there any outliers?**  
$IQR=Q_3−Q_1$=317.50−130.50=187.00

Lower Bound: $Q_1−1.5×IQR$=130.50−1.5×187.00=130.50−280.5=−150.00

Since no value can be negative, there are no lower outliers.

Upper Bound: $Q_3+1.5×IQR$=317.50+1.5×187.00=317.50+280.5=598.00

The maximum value (485.00) is less than the upper bound (598.00).
Based on the $1.5×IQR$ rule, there are no outliers in this data set.

**d. Explain the potential difference in the size of those four observations.**  
Younger Dolphins: Would have had less time to accumulate mercury, resulting in lower concentrations.

Older Dolphins: Would have had more time for the mercury to build up, leading to much higher concentrations.

This age difference would be a strong explanatory variable for the two distinct clusters of data you see.
